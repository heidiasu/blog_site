                    foster a homeless pet, or adopting a pet this blog will help you get started. There
                    are so many rescue facilities looking for volunteers to walk their dogs as they wait to
                    go into a foster home or to be adpoted. This a a great time to help the dog learn how to 
                    walk on a leash, sit for a treat, or chase a tennis ball and bring it back.You might 
                    even get to have a puppy pile in your lap.
                </p>
                <p class="m-content">Have you ever thought about fostering. Yes, it can be scary at first
                    but it is a very <em>rewarding</em> experience. You might be giving a pup it's first oppotunity 
                    to live in an home and know what life should be like for a family companion. fostering
                    is also perfect if you are not ready to adopt and want to get experience having a dog 
                    in your home. 
                </p>
                <p class="m-content">
                    Ready to adopt. Check out some of the rescues in your area. There are a lot, some that
                    speciailze in specific breeds, like Golden Retrievers or French Bulldogs, or focus on 
                    small dogs, large dogs, or older dogs. You can find the perfect companion if you do a 
                    little research and checkout the different rescues.
