                <p>I grew up in a home where we always had a couple of dogs and 
                    cats. We adopted some and also took in a couple of stray at 
                    times. Until I went away to college, I never knew a home without 
                    pets. 
                </p>
                <p>After I graduated from college I lived at home for a few years
                    before moving out on my own. I lived for about 10 years without 
                    a pet so about 9 years ago, after reading Facebook updates from a 
                    friend who fosters dogs, I decided to give it a try. Well, I 
                    fostered for about a week and then decided to adopt my first pup. 
                    I've fosterd many times since and also failed (adopted my foster pup)
                    so I can't foster anymore. Instead, I volunteer at the cities 
                    open-access shelter as well as a couple of no-kill shelters. It's 
                    definitely a great way to help our homeless pets find their new 
                    forver homes.
